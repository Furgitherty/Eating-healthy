            The vast array of healthy foods is seemingly infinite, though finite, and most of these food contribute to eating
            healthy.
            
            One of these foods is the infamous vegetables are made up of combinations that are beneficial to you,<br>
            such as vitamins, which help stable your mood and resist cancer, and dietary fiber, dietary fibers can decrease your cholestrol, 
            cholestrol is a substance found in every cell of our body and we need cholestrol to make hormones (a hormone is a substance that gives energy to cells)
            Vitamin D, and substances that make you digest food, <br> 
            however two much cholestrol can cause buildup in the walls of our ateries <br>
            according to "Slideshow Cholestrol 101 -- What Your Levels Mean" by Dany Paul Baby <br> 
            (the passageway that the heart uses to transport blood to all parts of our body), <br>
            therefore blood flow is hindered as there their passages are narrower than usual <br>
            this is detrimental as blood is a lifeline for the body, as it carries vitamins, heat, oxygen, etc <br>
            and carries away waste, and carbon dioxide. <br>

            In km.t (or Kemet) a land of ascension, power, and black brilliance, the diet was good for the body,
            which is the unification of both the sky and the earth according to km.t people, a person who eats
            healthy is someone who psychoanalyzes themself, is conscious of their thoughts, emotions, and actions
            being healthy according to "What is the Kemetic diet" by Afrikan Library, from the Km.t people
            is abstaining from meat, animal products, cooked foods, and junk foods and food should be 
            treated as sacred. <br>

            To be healthy you have to eat green vegetables as they contain chlorophyll and trap sunlight in you,
            also because the beings inside of us are also depicted to be green so eating green is a allegory
            of having these beings inside of us. <br>

            Another way to be healthy is eating starches on a daily basis as well as vegetables,
            the best starches are millet, corn, wheat or rice, lentils and for vegetables
            potatoes and yams are healthy choices according to the traidition of k.mt people. <br>

            k.mt people baked their food by letting it heat in the infrared rays of the sun, which we call today sunlight
            The k.mt people also believed that by eating green and organic foods one traps Ra in their body, or traps light
            in their body. <br>

            The foods to eat to be healthy are grains, root vegetables, and legumes,
            rice, wheat, potatoes should be boiled also because that is how it is supposed to be eaten. <br>

            Stay away from eggs, some nuts, some fruits, alcohol, and some meats like fish. <br>

            The way you eat connects to your mind, soul, and body, if you eat food that causes stress on your body
            it causes stress on your mind and soul. <br>

            Exercising and practicing yoga is also helpful to be helpful because according to km.t people 
            a heavy body mena a heavy soul, so extra fat can affect your soul unbeneficially. <br>

            Breath stimulates the life force and energy through the body, so practice breathing techniques 
            as these can also help you stay healthy, your breathing and movement must be precise
            and concentration, focus, and intention must be high according to the article "The Rule of Four Breath Control" by yirser <br>

            Take breath or life force in and let it rise to the middle of the forehead
            or Heru's center, hod the breath in for 1 to 2 seconds and let the life force saturate the blood and tissues.
            Exhale and let the energy force move into the move through the arms into the hand and fingers.
            Before you inhale again hold your breath in for 1 or 2 seconds before inhaling again. <br>

            Moving your body wihout adhering to this pattern is just empty motion or stretching, love and be patient
            with yourself, this training is life-long according to the article. <br>
